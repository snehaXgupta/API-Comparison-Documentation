# REST vs GraphQL: The API Showdown Developers Should Know About  

> Welcome to the great API debate. REST or GraphQL? One gives you tried-and-true structure. The other gives you flexibility. Let’s break it down in plain English — no jargon, just what you need to know.  



 REST: The Classic, Reliable Approach  

REST (short for **Representational State Transfer**) has been around for a long time. It’s familiar, well-documented, and does exactly what you expect.  

- REST APIs use different URLs for different types of data.  
 Example:  
  `/users`, `/posts`, `/comments`  

- They rely on standard HTTP methods that you probably already know:  
  - `GET` – to fetch data  
  - `POST` – to create new data  
  - `PUT` – to update existing data  
  - `DELETE` – to remove data  

- The server decides what data to send back. That means you often get the full set — whether you want everything or not.  



GraphQL: The Made-to-Order Option

-GraphQL is different. Instead of getting everything on the plate, you can ask for only what you want.
-GraphQL uses a single endpoint, often something like /graphql.
-You describe what data you want, and the server gives you exactly that.

Example GraphQL query

graphql
Copy
Edit
{
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
  }
}

➡ This returns just the user’s name and email — nothing more, nothing less.


✅ When REST Shines
-Simple, clear, and easy to learn
-Caching works out-of-the-box (CDNs handle it beautifully)
-Well-suited for apps with straightforward data structures


✅ When GraphQL Shines
-No extra data — you get only what you ask for
-Great for complex apps where data is linked or nested
-Puts more control in the hands of frontend developers


What to Watch Out For

REST

-Might give you more data than you need
-Could require multiple endpoints to handle different use cases

GraphQL

-Big or careless queries could slow things down
-Caching takes a bit more planning


So... REST or GraphQL?
Pick REST when:

-Your data is simple and fits cleanly into resources
-You want fast caching and predictable APIs


Pick GraphQL when:

-You want flexibility and precision in data requests
-Your app deals with complex relationships between data

Sometimes, the best choice is both! Many teams use REST for simpler parts of the app, and GraphQL where flexibility matters most.


Final Thought
Don’t choose based on what’s trendy. Choose based on what your app and team really need.
Both REST and GraphQL are great tools — what matters is using them wisely.
